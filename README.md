# legexml

## [WIP] XML standard for fully self-contained description US state legislative instruments.
OPF uses XML at certain points in our backend. This repo is for documenting it, standardizing it, and making it available. Considering our schema from a standards-based POV and not just a problem-solving POV facilitates robustness and interoperability.  

For now, the repo is a scratchpad. Eventually it will hold our schema and the final product of refactoring our ad-hoc beta XML to match.


Prior efforts in the space (-ish) we're aware of:
* [OASIS LegalDocumentML](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=legaldocml)
* [OpenCivicData (2014 archive link)](https://web.archive.org/web/20140707131451/https://opencivicdata.org/)
